- Main focus: get services up and running.
- Helped the dev team on two fronts:
    - Matteo was working on defining User Stories and getting them into Taiga
    - Lorenzo and Mattia were sysadmin-ing to get services up. 
- It seems we will use a management system in between scrum and kanban, due to the tools we're using
- Mood: 9
- Comments: Finally! Stuff actually works!
- Problems: Product Manager role is unfit for Ciancarini (as a professor), we split up his responsibilities between him and dev team.
