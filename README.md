# Twitter Tracker

A simple analysis tool for tweets, focused on geo-location. 
We made this for the 2020-2021 Course of Software Engineering. If you wish to test this yourself, read `instructions.md`.
Otherwise, you can see our public instance (here)[http://34.65.106.228:8080/]. Because of technical limitations with Twitter Developer API, requests are rate limited to 15 every 10 minutes. So remember that if you play with it too much you'll ruin the fun for everyone else.

## Development Process

Due to the nature of the course, a special emphasis was put on the development process. We used various tools, documented in the `docs` folder. The Final Report contains A LOT of information, so we suggest using the "Document Structure" shortcuts to your advantage.

## Final Product

In this repository, you'll find the `client` and `server` directories. I'm sure you can guess what they were used for. The DBCreator folder contains some script we used to create a tweet database of geolocalized tweets in Italy. 

## Considerations

Clearly, this is not the repository we will make public. Credential files are still there, so proceed with cautions. None of us are likely to need twitter developer authentication tied to our school account again, but that's no reason to play with it.
